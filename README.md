# Image_Classifier
  In this project, we will create a custom image classifier that we will train in the browser using TensorFlow.js. We will first load and run a popular pre-trained model called MobileNet for image classification in the browser. We will then use a technique called "transfer learning", which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model and customizes it to train for your application.
# Requirements
  1. Any modern browser.
  2. Webcam
# How to use?
  Open index.html file in your browser, this will turn on webcam, now press buttons A,B or C to classify current frame in that class.
# Credits
  TensorFlow.js
